   <h1>1st Project
   </h1>
	<h2><u>Brainstorming</u></h2>
     <li>AR disco dance floor? Touch parts of walls or shape and they start melting or colors flashing?</li>
     <li>the idea of pausing/glitching: being on phone takes u out of this world</li>
     <li>water ring toss game</li>
     <li>windows school of public health blinking eyes</li>
     <li>any generic campus sign glitch the words</li>
     <li>something with stop signs - (mirror/two cameras?)</li>
     <li>hand stickers: missing people pop up? nah</li>
     <li>shitting and crying a throwing up in Mississippi/something to highlight the water crisis?</li>
     
      <p>Ultimate future goals: scultpure gets all wispy/covered in clouds/fog and fades away or in and out; AR gallery/3d portfolio of works
      </p>
    <h2>Idea Decisions & OOP</h2>
        <p>Old wall-mounted landline in ceramics hallway: AR "Out of Order"</p>
    
        <ol>Make "out of order" letters in Blender: <i>either metallic waving bubbles or curly like a phone wire</i></ol>
        <ol>Create image target that is "Premier" logo (if this doesn't work, then grafitti phone)</ol>
        <ol>Vinyl cut image target if it works, if not, practice grafitti ("outdated"?)</ol>
        <ol>Connect image target with blender letters (<i>how would I import this to Unity?</i></ol>
        <ol>Test it out!</ol>
	

    <h2><u>The ~Journey~</u></h2>
       <p>My concept is the idea that landline telephones used to be revolutionary, but now they are so outdated that we can pass them and not even notice they are there. Payphones used to be prevalent and necessary, and universities used to provide "courtesy phones" throughout campus and residence halls. The rise of the cell phone made these services obsolete, and universities stopped providing these phones as recently as 2011! Universities redirected the money spent on phone lines to go towards broader wireless internet service, which is integral to our lives and smart cell phone use today. With this project, I wanted to highlight how quickly innovative, or "premier" technologies become obsolete or forgotten about. Like technology, the same is true for artists, celebrities, even our friendships and bodies. Anything which experiences the limelight will eventually come to pass. (There's also an element about how surveillance is increasingly unavoidable with smart phones compared to anonymous pay phones, but that's not a fully formed thought.)
        </p>
        <p>I'm representing this by juxtaposing the brand "Premier" of an old inoperable landline phone with AR bubble letters that say "Out of order" to highlight the irony. There is this relationship (conversation?) between the analog phone and eye and the need of a smart phone with a built in camera/eye to create this new digital interaction.

        <p>...</p>
        <p><b>My first day working on the project </b> I spent about 4 hours in Blender trying to make these balloon letters I saw on Tiktok. I had never used Blender before. I made the classic rookie mistake of not saving any part of my file at all. After about 4 hours, Blender crashed. I was going to try again, but my friend's dog chewed up my mouse, so I decided that was enough for the day.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>I decided to try to make bubble letters instead of those wild balloon letters. I found a great Youtube video that walked me through it, and I got these letters done in 10-12 hours and even added animations to them so it looked like they were rippling like bubbles. Part of the reason this took so long though is because at one point I could not fucking Remesh them! I was doing everything in the video like the guy was but the letters were not forming! It turns out, when I adjusted them to make them look all flowy/wonky/bubbly, I was moving some points so they were folding into each other in 3D space. Once I fixed that, I was golden. Smooth sailing.</p>
        <p>To get the clear, iridescent bubble material effect, the guy had me add a shit ton of nodes. I had no idea what this was, so I stopped halfway through that part. What I had seemed good enough.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p><b>Now to import these letters to Vuforia... </b> I couldn't/no longer had the time to figure out how to try to import the Blender animations to Vuforia, so I just imported the letters. However, I could not get the material I created to import to Vuforia. i susupect it's because of all of the nodes we used. So instead of a clear bubble look, I gave the bubbles a shiny metallic color, almost like mercury. I also decided to just have the letters still instead of spending time trying to figure out how to animate them in Vuforia.</p>
