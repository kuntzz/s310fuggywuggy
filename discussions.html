             <p><b>Notes:</b>
                <li>refuse crit unformed idea bc idea will change and shift once physical</li>
                <li>Bertrand Russell: knowledge by description & knowledge by acquaintance</li>
                <li>artwork: acquaintance with its <b>materiality</b>--> analysis follows because <em>material characteristics provide some type of cult. or personal association</em></li>
             </p>
             <h4>What role does the artist's intention play in the interpretation of their work? Do you agree with  Anoka Faruquee's argument?</h4>
                <p>(8.25.2022)   It is possible for some that the artist's intention doesn't play any role in the interpretation of their work if it is just a blind read with no context or "descriptive" knowledge. However, an artist's intention behind a work of art often gives context to a viewer's interpretation of it. Currently, I agree with Faruqee's argument that artist's intention, viewer's interpretation and the art object triangulate together to form a greater meaning and cultural understanding because the act of viewing and understanding art cannot exist independently from creating the art and all of the other elements attached to the piece.</p>
             <h4>How does the act of making work change the meaning? Have you ever experienced situations similar to the examples given in the text?</h4>
                <p>The act of making work can change the meaning because it is out of your head and into the real world and has the ability to go into other people's heads. You no longer have control over it once it exists. Also, like Faruqee said, work moving from an intangible idea to physical form will invariably change from its initial conception. An example I experienced was I painted a quick abstract painting when I was feeling pretty hurt and upset. I just chose colors that felt right without much thought. When I showed it to my friend, she said it looked very "angsty bisexual," and when I looked at it again I realized that I had chosen the colors of the bi flag and I was like "Wait, I am feeling very angsty bisexual right now!!"</p>
             <h4>Does this way of looking change your perspective on group critiques?</h4>
                <p>I don't have much experience with critiques, and I'm so glad I read this blog post before jumping into that realm. I used to think of critiques in terms of knowing the artist's intention before critiquing it from the stance of the intention. I didn't want to interpret something "wrong." Now I have the understanding that my interpretation is not inherently "wrong" if it does not align with the artist's intention; my interpretation and critique may simply lead to a broader understanding or more knowledge.</p>

                <p><b>Th. 8.25.2022</b> - We've always lived hybrid lives. Now "real"/physical and technology. Previously "real"/physical and spiritual or higher and lower realms that we can't reach. Now we can reach this non-physical realm thru screens and AR. A combo of two like what churches used to achieve. </p>

                  <p>- Mockery of original items/messages
    - Humor - easier to win people over
    - Using peopleâ€™s images against them
- Accessibility in understanding
- Anyone can do it; quicker/easier than painting
                     - Quicker to understand than writing pages of critique </p>
