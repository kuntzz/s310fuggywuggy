             <h2>Anoka Faruqee and 'The Labor of Looking'</h2>
             <a href="https://faruqeedriscollstudio.com/the-labor-of-looking-from-intention-to-interpretation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read here :-)</a>
             <p><b>Notes:</b>
                <li>refuse crit unformed idea bc idea will change and shift once physical</li>
                <li>Bertrand Russell: knowledge by description & knowledge by acquaintance</li>
                <li>artwork: acquaintance with its <b>materiality</b>--> analysis follows because <em>material characteristics provide some type of cult. or personal association</em></li>
             </p>
             <h4>What role does the artist's intention play in the interpretation of their work? Do you agree with  Anoka Faruquee's argument?</h4>
                <p>(8.25.2022)   It is possible for some that the artist's intention doesn't play any role in the interpretation of their work if it is just a blind read with no context or "descriptive" knowledge. However, an artist's intention behind a work of art often gives context to a viewer's interpretation of it. Currently, I agree with Faruqee's argument that artist's intention, viewer's interpretation and the art object triangulate together to form a greater meaning and cultural understanding because the act of viewing and understanding art cannot exist independently from creating the art and all of the other elements attached to the piece.</p>
             <h4>How does the act of making work change the meaning? Have you ever experienced situations similar to the examples given in the text?</h4>
                <p>The act of making work can change the meaning because it is out of your head and into the real world and has the ability to go into other people's heads. You no longer have control over it once it exists. Also, like Faruqee said, work moving from an intangible idea to physical form will invariably change from its initial conception. An example I experienced was I painted a quick abstract painting when I was feeling pretty hurt and upset. I just chose colors that felt right without much thought. When I showed it to my friend, she said it looked very "angsty bisexual," and when I looked at it again I realized that I had chosen the colors of the bi flag and I was like "Wait, I am feeling very angsty bisexual right now!!"</p>
             <h4>Does this way of looking change your perspective on group critiques?</h4>
                <p>I don't have much experience with critiques, and I'm so glad I read this blog post before jumping into that realm. I used to think of critiques in terms of knowing the artist's intention before critiquing it from the stance of the intention. I didn't want to interpret something "wrong." Now I have the understanding that my interpretation is not inherently "wrong" if it does not align with the artist's intention; my interpretation and critique may simply lead to a broader understanding or more knowledge.</p>

             <h2>Discussion 2: Project 1</h2>
               <h4>What is your concept? (Your why)</h4>
                  <p>(9.15.2022)   My concept is the idea that landline telephones used to be revolutionary, but now they are so outdated that we can pass them and not even notice they are there. Payphones used to be prevalent and necessary, and universities used to provide "courtesy phones" throughout campus and residence halls. The rise of the cell phone made these services obsolete, and universities stopped providing these phones as recently as 2011! Universities redirected the money spent on phone lines to go towards broader wireless internet service, which is integral to our lives and smart cell phone use today. With this project, I wanted to highlight how quickly innovative, or "premier" technologies become obsolete or forgotten about. Like technology, the same is true for artists, celebrities, even our friendships and bodies. Anything which experiences the limelight will eventually come to pass. (There's also an element about how surveillance is increasingly unavoidable with smart phones compared to anonymous pay phones, but that's not a fully formed thought.)
                  </p>
               <h4>How are you representing it visually through the app?</h4>
                  <p>I'm representing this by juxtaposing the brand "Premier" of an old inoperable landline phone with AR bubble letters that say "Out of order" to highlight the irony. There is this relationship (conversation?) between the analog phone and eye and the need of a smart phone with a built in camera/eye to create this new digital interaction.
                  </p>
               <h4>What research/information have you found related to this project and your concept? How did it inform your work?</h4>
                  <p>I researched Morse Code and the availability of landline phones in universities in the past. I had my idea already, but this research helped to solidify the concept.
                  </p>
