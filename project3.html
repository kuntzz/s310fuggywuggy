      <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p><b>(11/3/2022) Ok here is a stream of consciousness brainstorming I did and it feels a lil coockoo:</b> Different scream noises every time someone gets too close. Morse code. Bluetooth. How can I use bluetooth? Can gps connect? Idk morse code of like “I am not really an artist this is all a sham an illusion if you think this is real you are living in the trap they want you to be in you are in the cave just staring at shadows thinking they are the real thing but anyway… yeah okay enjoy this art that I made” when I enter an art gallery. no movement for a certain amount of time could light up and pull a sleepover move like “pssst. Are you up?” Eh no. press button when you cry: “you have cried # times today.” After 3 it could be like “are you okay? Maybe you should sleep” “oh you’ve cried # times today? Maybe you’d feel less like a loser if you acted less like one and actually contributed something to the world or your life other than tears” (that was harsh)  “buum badum bum bum” in microphone and it does a parrot thing where it repeats what you say back. can it do something if I stand in front of a certain thing? Like if I stand in a certain place maybe with a Bluetooth something can it play on a screen a video I recorded? For some reason the Black Eyed Peas keep popping up. “Let the beat rock. Let the beeeaat rooooccck.Lelelet the beat rock” “lets get it started HAH lets get it started in here” yeah I think morse code but what could be the trigger for that? IF IT HEARS A CERTAIN BLACK EYED PEAS SONG?? Oh lord this is a mess. …. a projector is kind of like shadows…. But uses light instead of the absence of it….my brain wants to go somewhere here but where?
         </p>
        <p>I also have a piece of paper I wrote all over that idk if I'll add
         </p>
        <p> I looked into using the Bluetooth feature to push a message to phones but what was available didn't seem like the path I wanted to go down
         </p>
	<p> Maybe lights and sound start when light is off</p>
       <h2>Progress/Process</h2>
          <p><b>Th. 11.3.2022 - </b> Today I brainstormed and coded the board to light up all neopixels when a button is pushed</p>
          <p> My idea is to have some recording play along with a collage displayed that talks about morse code and Plato's allegory of the cave and not everything is what it seems. A message saying "shadow exists because light exists" will be playing in Morse code on the playground
           </p>
          <p><i>To do next:</i> Set timer to do morse code message; write script; record script to play on speaker; get speaker to play sound file (how? button? link to file/button on collage file itself?); collect images and create collage
           </p>
	  
	  <p><b>Tu. 11.8.2022 - </b> I'm not sure I agree with that sentiment anymore: shadow exists because light exists.</p>
          
          <p><i>To do next:</i> 
           </p>
