   <h1>3rd Project
   </h1>
      <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p><b>(11/3/2022) Ok here is a stream of consciousness brainstorming I did and it feels a lil coockoo:</b> Different scream noises every time someone gets too close. Morse code. Bluetooth. How can I use bluetooth? Can gps connect? Idk morse code of like “I am not really an artist this is all a sham an illusion if you think this is real you are living in the trap they want you to be in you are in the cave just staring at shadows thinking they are the real thing but anyway… yeah okay enjoy this art that I made” when I enter an art gallery. no movement for a certain amount of time could light up and pull a sleepover move like “pssst. Are you up?” Eh no. press button when you cry: “you have cried # times today.” After 3 it could be like “are you okay? Maybe you should sleep” “oh you’ve cried # times today? Maybe you’d feel less like a loser if you acted less like one and actually contributed something to the world or your life other than tears” (that was harsh)  “buum badum bum bum” in microphone and it does a parrot thing where it repeats what you say back. can it do something if I stand in front of a certain thing? Like if I stand in a certain place maybe with a Bluetooth something can it play on a screen a video I recorded? For some reason the Black Eyed Peas keep popping up. “Let the beat rock. Let the beeeaat rooooccck.Lelelet the beat rock” “lets get it started HAH lets get it started in here” yeah I think morse code but what could be the trigger for that? IF IT HEARS A CERTAIN BLACK EYED PEAS SONG?? Oh lord this is a mess. …. a projector is kind of like shadows…. But uses light instead of the absence of it….my brain wants to go somewhere here but where?
         </p>
        <p>I also have a piece of paper I wrote all over that idk if I'll add
         </p>
        <p> I looked into using the Bluetooth feature to push a message to phones but what was available didn't seem like the path I wanted to go down
         </p>
	<p> Maybe lights and sound start when light is off</p>
       <h2>Progress/Process</h2>
          <p><b>Th. 11.3.2022 - </b> Today I brainstormed and coded the board to light up all neopixels when a button is pushed</p>
             <p> My idea is to have some recording play along with a collage displayed that talks about morse code and Plato's allegory of the cave and not everything is what it seems. A message saying "shadow exists because light exists" will be playing in Morse code on the playground
                </p>
             <p><i>To do next:</i> Set timer to do morse code message; write script; record script to play on speaker; get speaker to play sound file (how? button? link to file/button on collage file itself?); collect images and create collage
                </p>
	  
	  <p><b>Tu. 11.8.2022 - </b> I'm not sure I agree with that sentiment anymore: shadow exists because light exists.</p>
             <p>My eyes are fucking raw from looking at the neopixels so much, but today I coded the board so that when it gets dark the light sensor will tell the neopixels to read in morse code whatever sentence I programmed.
	        </p>
	     <p>Reading between the lines; don't accept what the display or cover or forefront of what is being shown to you. I think I want to have an audio file play that is sending a different message from the morse code lights, but only those reading between the lines or looking further will actually know the intended? real? message. But then what is the true message? Why not the obvious one? Well I think it's to represent a system within which you grow up and if the system doesn't harm you directly you dont really grow up seeing what's wrong and thinking about how it can be better. Personal experience is a powerful thing. But if that noise doesn't sound right then eventually you wonder "what else is out there?" And <i>that's</i> when you see the morse code. <i>That's</i> when you look behind the wall or venture out of the cave. That's when the clouds become animals or an idea turns into a painting.
	        </p>
	     <p>That's what I'm trying to get at or something</p>
             <p><i>To do next:</i> Re-evaluate the message I want to send (what is the cave representing in particular,, if you feel isolated or confused, re-evaluate the lense through which you see the world, leave the bubble/perspective you're in and find one that seems right to you), think of and write what topic I want to talk about, what morse code message will reveal, make audio file and figure out how to distort it, for future and maybe not this project: have a visualizer playing on the screen  
                </p>
	  <p><b>Th. 11.10.2022 - </b> I did not accomplish much physically today. I did some research, but I am not yet efficient in researching. I hope the meaning/intention of this project takes shape soon. I can feel it knocking around in there like when I'm doing a word search and I know there's a word in some vicinity but I just don't see it yet.
	        </p>
          <p><b>Tu. 11.15.2022 - </b> Okay so my final idea is to have a bunch of doubts bouncing around like they do in your head. Then the circuit playground says "resist persist" in morse code. Today I created the gif and changed the morse code to flash that message.
	        </p>
	      <p><i>Still to do: </i> Add morse code key to gif. Bring something to cover lights (cup? head?)
		  </p>
	      <p><u>To take project further: </u> Potentially this would be a full projection framed by a light strip (noods?) which would be what is flashing instead of the circuit playground. There's probably more that can be done here.
	          </p>
	  <p><b>Th. 11.17.2022 - </b> Today I added morse code to the gif in photoshop. I don't like the speed as much as in the original one from Procreate.</p>
              <p>To take project further: A large installation with a frame light strip or that is lit up. The frame will start the morse code message when someone stands in front of it (ultrasonic distance sensor). Maybe a podium with paper and pencils for people to try to figure it out if they want.
                  </p>
