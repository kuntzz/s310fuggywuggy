	      <h2><u>Brainstorming</u></h2>
            <p><b>Tu. 11.29.2022 - </b> I want to comment on or recreate escapism, especially what happened for me (and I assume others) through the end of quarantine and re-entering normal life. I feel like I have become out of touch and self-centered, which feels really uncomfortable.
       I mean I was 20 when it started, freshly out of being a kid. The adult world was new to me and I hadn't navigated on my own before, and with the 2020 quarantine I really was on my own, but the world wasn't how it usually is. But it was. I don't know.
       At some point it seems like I retreated into myself. Maybe the world didn't make sense because of me/my perception and "mental illnesses." Perhaps I thought if I solved my own mental problems--hacked my brain and rewired it-- that would make the world make more sense. Although I grew more connected to my innerself
       for some time, ultimately I lost touch with the rest of the world. (It doesn't have to make sense if you just escape it and don't think about it). There's no conclusion yet, I just want to be in touch with people again.
            </p>
            <p> To be brief, I am thinking of something like images or news headlines or videos or sounds of real-world issues that get covered in smoke or psychedellicaly visually warped and swallowed up. Maybe the sounds get distorted until you can't understand them anymore.

	     <p><b>Tu. 12.06.2022 - </b> I'm just gonna copy and paste my notes from today:</p>
           <ul>//steps:
                   <li>//make xs and ys random #s within canvas bounds CHECK12.6</li>
                   <li>//remive mouse Pressed let line loop infinitely BOOYAH 12.6</li>
                   <li></li>
                   <li>//ideally get it to draw circles or curves</li>
                   <li>//ideally make color rainbow or each line/curve a random color CHECK12.6</li>
                   <li>////got it to choose random from color array, but it's all grayscale 12.6</li>
                   <li>////moved array and color defs to setup function, used color method on RGB numbers 12.6</li>
                   <li>//get photo as background</li>
                   <li>//when press clear, new photo appears</li>
           </ul>

           <ul>//2 THINGS IM GONNA TRY 12.6
                <li>//connect line to previous point</li>
                   <li>////I tried this using an if statement and it didn't work</li>
                <li>//draw circles instead of lines</li>
           </ul>
	   
	   
<h2>Idea for independent study:</h2>
     <p>use photos to make pattern like spirograph or penrose tiles</p>
