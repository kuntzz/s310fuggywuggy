    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
      <h4>Rambles</h4>
	    <p> I have noticed my interest in the relationships between memory, loss, and connection. I enjoy my work more when it explores these ideas, and it is cool to see how I can express these feelings and comment on these topics using different mediums. However, this general theme is very broad and can be a hindrance to creating sometimes.
	    </p>
        <p>The whole thing about being human is that we can see experience as frames of moments separated by time/space. Instead of seeing/experiencing everything as happening all at once or as completely separate instances, the unique thing about the human experience is that we can see how all of these moments connect and relate to each other and inform new moments and lead to a culmination of something. We do this through following history, chemistry, physics, roadways and highway systems, studying the body, nutrients, moods, root systems, waterways, climate change and pollution, grades in school, coding, painting, sculpture, sex, the creation of anything! Rather than just seeing something that is, we have the ability to see all of the parts that had to come together for something to be.</p>
        <p>Our memory allows for us to do this. But how does our memory come to be? Do we know? Our memories and experiences, individually and collectively, are pieces that come together to make up our identity. But our identity can also influence our memories and how we experience things. It's such a whirlwind.</p>
        <p>We lose memories. Do we retain our identity even when memories of those exerpeinces which helped form us are lost? What role does nostalgia play in this. Does it unlock memories that we had forgotten? Are we fond of them simply because we get them back, not necessarily because it was a good experience? Do we like to see/feel more comfortable when we can see all of the things that led to where we are (they are still if they are in the past)? Is this why we romanticize the past? It's harder to pick out these moments while we're experiencing them (they are still in motion).</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>I also have an interest in creating work that is interactive. Sometimes, art should be freeing. I want people to touch my art and play with it and feel like they are a part of it, not just some separate observer. I think this idea mirrors... memory? Experiencing life? As we grow up, people tell us not to touch things or not to be too loud or to be on our "best behavior" but then tell us what that is instead of letting us decide what makes us most comfortable.</p>
        <p>I know I'm rambling, I just feel like there's some connection between all of these thoughts.</p>
    
    <h4>The Project</h4>
      <p><b>cameron's world: geocities collage, museum of old internet pages</b></p>
      <p><b>dreamlinks: javascript to paint images (wispy)</b></p>
      <p><b>pointilism:</b> <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html">https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html</a></p>
        <p>pointilism that creates an image but stops right before you can make out what it is going to be; click, and a new drawing starts</p>
        <p>using old family images, but also historical american images, glitch some of the images, old memes or viral video stills, vines?</p>
        <p>dragging the mouse drags an image(hold click), clicking can change the image?</p>
        <p>clicking can set an image down and each click changes to a random photo selection (with random tint?)</p>
        <p>maybe translucent vid of user displaying behind the collage being created</p>
        <p>after an amount of time, captures image from video and adds to collage database</p>
        <p><i>Something to add later: people can submit their own images and it will add them to a database that the collage-maker pulls from</i></p>
    
     <h2>First OOP</h2>
        <ol>find family photos (maybe start with 2)</ol>
        <ol>glitch them</ol>
        <ol>Originals will be used for pointilism</ol>
        <ol>glitched will show up when click (and drag)</ol>
        <ol>mouse at certain parts of the screen camera will show up under image being created</ol>
